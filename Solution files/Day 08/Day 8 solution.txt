Day 8 = COUNTROWS(FILTER(
                          SUMMARIZE(Orders, Orders[OrderID], "No of products", COUNTA(Orders[ProductID])),
                          [No of products] = 1
                        )
                )


To understand this:
- SUMMARIZE(Orders, Orders[OrderID], "No of products", COUNTA(Orders[ProductID]))
This summarizes the orders table by the order id, and the number of products per order id

- The next part of the code filters the summary table we created for cases where the number of products ordered is equal to 1
- The final part now counts the rows of data from our filtered table where number of products = 1
