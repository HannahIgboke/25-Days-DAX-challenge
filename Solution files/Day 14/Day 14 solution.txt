CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(Customers[CustomerID]), EXCEPT(allcustomers, customers_who_purchased_QC))

-- Quick explanation

- Create variable allcustomers that gets a list of distinct customers from the customers table
- A second variable that creates a list of customers who have purchased Queso Cabrales.
- The output does a distinct count of customers who are on the allcustomers list and are not the customers_who_purchased_QC list.
