Day 2 = CALCULATE(
                  SELECTEDVALUE(Products[ProductName]), 
                  TOPN(1, Products, [Unit Price], DESC)
                  )

-- Quick explanation
The DAX above is broken into two parts

1. TOPN(1, Products, [Unit Price], DESC)

This selects the top 1 row of data after organizing the unit price column of the products table in descending order.


2. SELECTEDVALUE(Products[ProductName])

This part helps us select only the product name from the row of data 

P.S CALCULATE is a DAX funcction that is used to evaluate an expression in a modified filter context.
