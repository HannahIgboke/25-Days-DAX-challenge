Day 11 = CALCULATE(
                    COUNTROWS(
                        FILTER(SUMMARIZE(ALL(Orders), Orders[CustomerID], "No_of_times_purchased", DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[OrderID])),
                        [No_of_times_purchased] = 1)
                        )
                  )

This can be broken down into stages:

- First Summarize the orders table by the customer_id and the number of times they have placed orders.
- Next filter this table for cases where the number of times purchased is equal to 1.
- Finally count the rows of data that meet our filter criterion.
