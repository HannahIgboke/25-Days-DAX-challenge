-- First create a measure that finds the maximum unit price from the product table

Max price = MAX(Products[UnitPrice])


-- The second measure

Day 2 = CALCULATE( MAX(Products[ProductName]), FILTER(Products, Products[Unit Price] = [Max price]))


-- Quick explanation of the logic of the code above

CALCULATE is a DAX function that is used to change the context of something. It's like saying calculate something for me but use the following conmditions to do so.
MAX(Products[ProductName]) - this argument alone would give you the max product name in the column, which isn't what we want.
FILTER(Products, Products[Unit Price] = [Max price]) - the second argument helps us
