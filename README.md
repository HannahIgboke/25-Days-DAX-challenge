# What is DAX?

DAX stands for "Data Analysis Expressions." It is a formula language and a collection of functions used for creating custom formulas in Power BI, Excel Power Pivot, and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) Tabular models. DAX is designed for data modeling and business intelligence tasks and is widely used in Microsoft's suite of business analytics tools.

For this challenge however I'll be using Power BI.
